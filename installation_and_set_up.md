## Overview

[There should be graph contains our above, more than gym-unrealcv]


## System preparation

The installation of CUDA is one of the hardest part for newbies, [the official guide is excellent](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/).

And you can also refer to my [ystem_configuration](https://github.com/MiaoDX/system_configuration/blob/master/program.md) if encounter problems.

## Opencv build from source

[...]

## Tensorflow

The library includes in the `Anaconda` suite is not so good as [the official step by step guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux).

## Unrealcv

unrealcv and related gym-unrealcv is just pretty straightforward to install/build.
